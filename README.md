# yet-another-rp2040-macropad

This Git repository provides step-by-step instructions and code samples for building a simple macropad using the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller board. A macropad is a programmable keypad with customizable buttons that can be used to automate tasks, streamline workflows, or enhance productivity.

The Raspberry Pi Pico is a powerful yet affordable microcontroller board that offers a wide range of possibilities for DIY projects. By following the instructions in this repository, you'll be able to create your own macropad using the Pico and a few additional components.

For this project I'm using a board from [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-lcd-1.28.htm) (RP2040 MCU Board, With 1.28inch Round LCD) that was laying around here. It uses a raspberry pi pico (rp2040) as its microcontroler, so it's possible to build a HID (Human Interface Device). In this repository, you'll discover a convenient housing specifically designed for this project. It includes designated spots for the Waveshare board, rotary encoder, and mechanical switches, ensuring a clean and organized assembly.
