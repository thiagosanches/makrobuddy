# yet-another-rp2040-macropad

This Git repository provides step-by-step instructions and code samples for building a simple macropad using the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller board. A macropad is a programmable keypad with customizable buttons that can be used to automate tasks, streamline workflows, or enhance productivity.

The Raspberry Pi Pico is a powerful yet affordable microcontroller board that offers a wide range of possibilities for DIY projects. By following the instructions in this repository, you'll be able to create your own macropad using the Pico and a few additional components.

For this project I'm using a board from [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-lcd-1.28.htm) (RP2040 MCU Board, With 1.28inch Round LCD) that was laying around here. It uses a raspberry pi pico (rp2040) as its microcontroler, so it's possible to build a HID (Human Interface Device). In this repository, you'll discover a convenient housing specifically designed for this project. It includes designated spots for the Waveshare board, rotary encoder, and mechanical switches, ensuring a clean and organized assembly.

**Important:** Please take note that the LCD in my previous assembly was accidentally damaged during this project. Therefore, it is crucial to exercise caution when mounting the LCD into the housing or avoid any potential mishaps, such as dropping it on the floor.

- Some wires.
- Hot glue (to keep the wires on the waveshare board, since I don't have some male 1.27 pins).
- Soldering iron.
- 3d printed housing  (you can use the one that I've built [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/47IuxGAQAh5)).
